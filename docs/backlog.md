# Backlog

## Make automatic updates visible to players

- **Status:** Deferred; keep Forge compatibility as the current priority.
- **Reported:** 2026-10-28, during the 0.1.0 to 0.1.1 update.
- **Observed:** The user saw no update message, but confirmed that a new executable downloaded and the previous executable was renamed to an old copy. This confirms update file activity; the running version was not independently checked.
- **Follow-up:** Review notifications for startup updates and updates downloaded during play. Make it clear when an update is downloading, ready for restart, successfully installed, or failed. Show the installed version so players can confirm the result without inspecting executable files.
- **Acceptance:** Verify both update paths from an official release with a scratch profile. A completed startup update gives a visible version confirmation; an update downloaded during play provides a clear restart notice. Failure or rollback does not report success. Preserve existing profile data and executable recovery behavior.

This entry records future work only; no updater behavior changes are included.
